# Android Malware Detection With Deep Neural Network
This project aims to develop advanced methods for malware detection on Android devices. 
We use Deep Neural Networks and Deep Learning techniques to analyze the complex patterns of APKs, achieving promising results in accuracy and efficiency. 
This enables us to mitigate threats in real-time through a mobile application.
